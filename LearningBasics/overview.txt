overview

accounts:
there are two types of accounts in ethereum:

external accounts: are controlled by public-private keys
>Humans
Address of external account is determined by the public key

Contract accounts are controlled by the code stored with the account
address of a contract is determined at the time the contract is created

-------------------------------------------------------------
Transactions:

A transaction is a message that is sent from one account to another
-it can contain binary data which is called 'payload' and Ether

if the target account contains code, that code is executed and the payload is
provided as input data

If the target account is not set(trans doesnt have a recipient or set to NULL)
-The transaction creates a new contract

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gas:

uppon creation the transaction is charged with a certian amount of gas,
the gas is to limit the amount of work needed to execute the transaction

the gas price is a value set by the creator of the transaction who has to pay gas * gas_price
up front from sending the account, if gas is left over afterwords, the gas is refunded

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
storage memory and the stack:

each account has a data area called storage which is persistent between function calls and trans,
storage is a key-value store that maps 256 bit words to 256 bit words

the second data area is called memory:
linear and can be addressed at byte level, reads are limited to width of 256 bits
